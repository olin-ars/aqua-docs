# OARS (Olin Aquatic Robotic Systems) :sailboat::ocean:

*Last modified 2020-09-19*

## Purpose

OARS likes water and weâ€™re a big fan of things that go in it. We work to build networks
and relationships with companies and professionals within and outside Olin to co-design
and co-develop boats, water bots, aquatic hardware, and software.

## Membership

Anyone is welcome to attend meetings at any time, announced or unannounced, either as a
guest or as a member. If OARS attends conferences and/or events, only official team
members are allowed and able to attend (unless otherwise discussed and agreed upon by
Leadership or by team-wide vote).

## Officers and Roles

There are several roles within the Leadership structure of OARS:
- Cap'n of the Voyage (project manager)
- Cap'n of Coin (treasurer)
- Champion of Happiness (team health lead)
- First Mates (subteam leads)

The Cap'n of the Voyage is responsible for documenting subteam stand-ups and other
important information regarding in-person meetings. Outside of meetings, all members of
Leadership should document any information relating to themselves and their subteams
(if applicable).

The Cap'n of Coin is responsible for collecting, processing, and recording all purchasing
requests sent to them by members of the team. All financial transactions should be signed
off and approved by the Cap'n of Coin to ensure proper documentation and accounting.

The Champion of Happiness is responsible for purchasing club-related snacks, as well as
checking in with OARS members both mentally and physically. If at any time a member: does
not feel safe; is disrespected; or feels unhappy, either due to another OARS member or
because of a Team decision, that member may file a report (formally or informally) to the
Champion of Happiness, who will take appropriate action as outlined in the Olin Honor
Code.

These are to say, OARS is and should remain a democratic club, and important decisions 
should take into consideration the perspectives, ideas, and votes of all its established 
Buccaneers (members).

## Transition Protocol

At the end of each academic year, prior to Finals, Leadership must reassess its members
and reassign roles depending on the work and time commitment of existing and new members. This task should be transparent to the rest of the Team, taking into consideration its
members' opinions.

Upon role switching, the passing of knowledge and responsibility is critical and must
extend beyond simple title changes. Principle examples include transferring the ownership
of the GitHub repositories, the Slack workspace, Asana board, and other tools used by the
Team. Credentials for tools must also be communicated and recorded by the newly assigned.

## Club Assets

- the ors@lists.olin.edu mailing list
- oars.club, olinars.club, olinaquaticroboticsystems.club
- locked big storage container (and contents) behind the MAC
  * boats (many)
  * electronics (motors, computers, microcontrollers, NVIDIA Jetson TX2, etc.)
  * furniture (workspace tables, etc.)

## Expected Purchases

- web infrastructure (website and server hosting): _$25-30 per year_
- snacks for meetings (exempting breaks and off-campus periods): _$200-300 per year_
- miscellaneous electrical and mechanical parts: _project dependent_

## Events and Activities

OARS occurs weekly (unless otherwise communicated by Leadership) at a time that works
best for the active and participating members of the Team. That time and date is defined
at the beginning of every academic semester and may be amended by the Team via democratic
voting at any time.

OARS may also attend non-routine events and gatherings, for which a schedule will be sent
to and discussed with the members of the Team from either the Cap'n of the Voyage or
another active member of Leadership.

## Amendment Procedure

Anyone may propose an amendment to this charter at any time with a pull request on GitHub
or by communicating a change via email or Slack message to any active members of
Leadership.

## Code of Conduct

All club members are expected to follow the Olin Honor Code in all activities, both
inside and outside of Olin. If anyone violates any of its included tenants, reports may
be filed with OARS' Champion of Happiness or directly to the Honor Board.
