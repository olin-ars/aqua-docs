# OARS (Olin Aquatic Robotic Systems) :sailboat::ocean:

*Last modified 2020-09-19*

## Purpose

OARS likes water and weâ€™re a big fan of things that go in it. We work to build networks and
relationships with companies and professionals within and outside Olin to co-design and
co-develop boats, water bots, aquatic hardware, and software.

## Membership

Anyone is welcome to attend meetings at any time, announced or unannocuned, either as a guest
or as a member. If OARS attends conferences and/or events, only official team members are
allowed and able to attend (unless otherwise discussed and agreed upon by Leadership or by
teamwide vote).

## Officers and Roles

There are several roles within the Leadership structure of OARS:
- Cap'n of the Voyage (project manager)
- Cap'n of Coin (treasurer)
- Champion of Happiness (team health lead)
- First Mates (subteam leads)

These are to say, OARS is and should remain a democratic club and important decisions should
take into consideration the perspectives, ideas, and votes of all its established Buccaneers
(members).

## Transition Protocol

At the end of each academic year, prior to Finals, Leadership must reassess its members and
reassign roles depending on the work and time commitment of existing and new members. This task
should be transparent to the rest of the Team, taking into consideration its members' opinions.

Upon role switching, the passing of knowledge and responsibility is critical and must extend
beyond simple title changes. Princple examples include transferring the ownership of the GitHub
repositories, the Slack workspace, Asana board, and other tools used by the Team. Credentials for
tools must also be communicated and recorded by the newly assigned.

## Club Assets

- the ors@lists.olin.edu mailing list
- oars.club, olinars.club, olinaquaticroboticsystems.club
- locked big storage container (and contents) behind the MAC
  * boats (many)
  * electronics (motors, computers, microcontrollers, NVIDA Jetson TX2, etc.)
  * furniture (workspace tables, etc.)

## Expected Purchases

- web infrastructure (website and server hosting): _$25-30 per year_
- snacks for meetings (exempting breaks and off-campus periods): _$200-300 per year_
- miscellaneous electrical and mechanical parts: _project dependent_

## Events and Activities

OARS occurs weekly (unless otherwise communicated by Leadership) at a time that works best for
the active and participating members of the Team. That time and date is defined at the beginning
of every academic semester and may be amended by the Team via democratic voting at any time.

OARS may also attend non-routine events and gatherings, for which a schedule will be sent to and
disucssed with the members of the Team from either the Cap'n of the Voyage or another active
member of Leadership.

## Amendment Procedure

Anyone may propose an amendment to this charter at any time with a pull request on GitHub or by
communicating a change via email or Slack message to any active members of Leadership.

## Code of Conduct

All club members are expected to follow the Olin Honor Code in all activities, both inside and
outside of Olin. If anyone violates any of its included tenants, reports may be filed with OARS'
Champion of Happiness or directly to the Honor Board.
