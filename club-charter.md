# OARS (Olin Aquatic Robotic Systems)

*Last modified 2020-09-18*

## Purpose

OARS likes water and weâ€™re a big fan of things that go in it. We aspire to continue building networks and relationships with companies and professionals outside Olin to co-design and co-develop boats, water bots, aquatic hardware, and software.

## Membership

Anyone is welcome to attend our meetings, either has a guest or as a member.

## Officers and Roles

Two officers manage Snek Club, a primary leader (known as the Tail) and a
secondary leader (known as the Head).

## Transition Protocol

In keeping with the concept of _ouroboros_, at the end of each year, the Head
"eats" the Tail, becoming the primary leader of the club (the Tail) and
fulfilling the circle of life and death. A new Head is chosen from the
membership at a candle-lit ceremony on the last full moon of the school year
through excellence voting of all attendees. If the former Head chooses not to
"eat" the Tail, a new Tail is chosen with the same process.

## Club Assets

- the snek@lists.olin.edu mailing list
- locked storage cabinet on the 4th floor of the AC (containing NO LIVE
  SNAKES)
- various secret shrines in Parcel B

## Expected Purchases

We generally purchase frozen mice, candles, and eggs on a regular basis (around
$15/month).  Periodically (about once every two years) we'll probably need to
augment our long-term supplies of snakes costumes (both for people and snakes)
plastic boxes with breathing holes, and humane animal traps (around $100 every
two years).

## Events and Activities

SNACs occur roughly every month, where members will share their latest
snek-related news and consume visually-snek-related confections. Daily
excursions are made to the locked closet on the fourth floor of the AC.

## Amendment Procedure

Anyone may propose an amendment to this charter with a pull request on GitHub or
by emailing the current Head/Tail or any CCO director.

## Code of Conduct

All club members are expected to follow the Olin Honor Code in all activities.

During trips into Parcel B, members are expected to leave no trash behind,
respect the neighboring private properties, and not release any non-native
snake species.

Additionally, all club members are expected to adhere to the following
pledge, adapted from the [Contributer Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
