# OARS (Olin Aquatic Robotic Systems) :sailboat::ocean:

*Last modified 2020-09-18*

## Purpose

OARS likes water and weâ€™re a big fan of things that go in it. We aspire to continue
building networks and relationships with companies and professionals outside Olin to
co-design and co-develop boats, water bots, aquatic hardware, and software.

## Membership

Anyone is welcome to attend meetings at any time, announced or unannocuned, either as a guest
or as a member. If OARS attends conferences and/or events, only official team members are
allowed and able to attend (unless otherwise discussed and agreed upon by Leadership or by
teamwide vote).

## Officers and Roles

There are several roles within the Leadership structure of OARS:
- Cap'n of the Voyage (project manager)
- Cap'n of Coin (treasurer)
- Champion of Happiness (team health lead)
- First Mates (subteam leads)

These are to say, OARS is and should remain a democratic club and important decisions should
take into consideration the perspectives, ideas, and votes of all its established Buccaneers
(members).

## Transition Protocol

At the end of each academic year, prior to Finals, Leadership must reassess its members and
reassign roles depending on the work and time commitment of existing and new members. This task
should be transparent to the rest of the team, taking into consideration its members' opinions.

Upon role switching, passing of knowledge and responsibility should extend beyond simple title
changes (principally, in transferring of ownership of GitHub repositories, the Slack
workspace, Asana board, and other tools used by The Team).

## Club Assets

- the ors@lists.olin.edu mailing list
- oars.club, olinars.club, olinaquaticroboticsystems.club
- locked big storage container (and contents) behind the MAC
  * boats (many)
  * computers (big and small)
  * furniture (workspace tables)

## Expected Purchases

- web infrastructure (website and server hosting): _$25-30 per year_
- snacks on a regular baisis for meetings (exempting breaks and off-campus periods): _$200-300 per year_
- miscellaneous electrical and mechanical parts: _project dependent_

## Events and Activities

SNACs occur roughly every month, where members will share their latest
snek-related news and consume visually-snek-related confections. Daily
excursions are made to the locked closet on the fourth floor of the AC.

## Amendment Procedure

Anyone may propose an amendment to this charter with a pull request on GitHub or
by emailing the current Head/Tail or any CCO director.

## Code of Conduct

All club members are expected to follow the Olin Honor Code in all activities.

During trips into Parcel B, members are expected to leave no trash behind,
respect the neighboring private properties, and not release any non-native
snake species.

Additionally, all club members are expected to adhere to the following
